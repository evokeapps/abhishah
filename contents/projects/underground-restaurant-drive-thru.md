# Underground Restaurant Drive Thru

## Requirements:

Deliver orders from inside the kitchen to a temperature controlled Cache outside through an exterior wall and then underground to a AUTTR (Autonomous Underground Transport Robot)

## Responsibilities:

Product owner and mechanical engineer for Input Portal and Caching System
Industrial Design, Mech. Design, Project Planning, Controls Planning,
Testing, Assembly

## Results:

* Successfully passed the equivalent of two months of
continuous use testing, ensuring long-term durability
* Designed an electrical box with a slider and cam-lock
mechanism for easy access and secure operation
* Developed a custom spring-loaded plunger mechanism for
controlled engagement
* Integrated a stepper-actuated belt and pulley system with
encoder, hall-effect, flag, beam break, and proximity sensors for
precise positioning and feedback
* Created a CAD Master Model for the entire system, streamlining
subsystem integration and design consistency
