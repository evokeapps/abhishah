# Pull Test Rail Bracket

## Requirements:

System that enables a cart to selectively traverse straight or right based on controlled path selection.

## Responsibilities:

End to End Mechanical development: Requirements Document, Project Scheduling, Mech. Design, Controls Planning, Assembly and Testing

## Results:

* Smaller footprint than a 4-way junction, enabling installation in tighter spaces
* Utilizes stepper motors with lead screws and ﬂag sensors for accurate endpoint conﬁrmation
* Engineered to support up to 100 lbs
* Planned mechanical linkage to synchronize track movement, preventing simultaneous actuation errors
* Turn geometry informed by insights from torture track testing for improved reliability
