# Baseball 4 Way Junction

## Requirements:

Enable AUTTR to selectively traverse straight, right, or left based on controlled path selection.

AUTTR - Autonomous Underground Tote Transportation Robot

## Responsibilities:

End to End Mechanical development: Requirements Document, Project Scheduling, Mech. Design, Controls Planning, Assembly and Testing

## Results:

* A baseball-style turntable pre-positions the trackin
sub-1-second, eliminating the need for the AUTTR to slow down
or stop
* Engineered for seamless assembly and disassembly within
underground vaults, ensuring future upgradability
* Integrated a stepper motor with a gearbox to achieve a balance
of speed and torque
* Implemented a flexible coupler to absorb entry impact, reducing
mechanical stress
* Designed with a continuously variable turn radius, enabling
fine-tuned control over entry and exit profiles
* Equipped with flag sensors for homing and position
confirmation
