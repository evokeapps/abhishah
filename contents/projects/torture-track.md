# Torture Track

## Requirements:

Stress test the cart on allowable install tolerances. Test cart cornering on different entry and exit proﬁle.

## Responsibilities:

End to End Mechanical development: Requirements Document, Project Scheduling, Mech. Design and Assembly

## Results:

- Designed four corner proﬁles with varying entry and exit geometries to analyze cart dynamics at different speeds and turn radii
- Engineered vertical and horizontal offsets at deﬁned values to evaluate the behavior of magnetic suspensions under controlled stress conditions
