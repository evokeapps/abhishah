# Graft Tissue Injector and Storage

## Requirements:

End to end mechanical development of a custom syringe, adapter and storage container for cornea graft tissue

## Responsibilities:

Industrial Design, Mechanical Design, vendor development, testing, documentation and client relationship

## Results:

- Co-inventor of U.S. Patent # [11957569](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11957569) ; [20200276010](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20200276010)
- _Top Image_: Cornea Graft Tissue storage. Designed a cornea graft storage system that suspends tissue between two liquid
  membranes, enabling real-time health inspection under a microscope
- _Bottom Image_: Developed a custom syringe with a specialized adapter for controlled graft tissue delivery and extraction
- Utilized cleanroom manufacturing, sterilization, and packaging to meet stringent medical standards
- Worked with patent lawyers and surgeons to refine the design and ensure clinical feasibility
