# ICON Wire Chain Spool

## Requirements:

Simplify 800 lbs of cable chain spooling and transportation

## Responsibilities:

Developed and presented several options at different levels of cost, automation and manufacturing techniques. Designed one from idea to product.

## Results:

- Designed a pawl and ratchet mechanism to enable two-way drive while preventing unintentional backdrive from cable chain weight
- Engineered a balanced gearbox for eï¬ƒcient single-person
  operation with minimal rotations.
- Integrated a caster with a locking mechanism on one side and a V-groove wheel for guided movement along 3D printer rails
- Designed forklift points for seamless loading and unloading
- Implemented a manual lockout mechanism for added operational security
